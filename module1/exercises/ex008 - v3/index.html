    <h1> Other formatting </h1>

    <h2> Source code / preformatted text </h2>
    <p>The command <code>document.getElementById('test")</code> is written in Javascript. </p>


    <pre>
        <code>
        num = int(input("Enter a number:"))
        if num % 2 ==0:
            print(f'The number {num} is EVEN!');
        else:
            print(f'This number is ODD!');

        print("Program closed!")
        </code>
    </pre>


    <h2> Short quotation </h2>
    
    <p> As my friend's father would said: <q>The computer is a very fast donkey!</q> </p>

    <h2> Blockquote quotation </h2>

    <p>According to Jon Duckett, in his book 'Beginning Web Programming with HTML, XHTML, and CSS':  </p>
    <blockquote cite="https://www.google.com.br/books/edition/Beginning_Web_Programming_with_HTML_XHTM/ktWrCHuWqgkC?hl=en&gbpv=0">
        If you are using tables with dimensions given in pixels, you are confining the use of the site to a browser on a desktop computer. It will not be accessible to those with smaller-screened devices such as PDAs or mobile phones, and it probably will not work on TV set top boxes because TVs have lower resolutions than computer screens (320 x 340 in the U.S if you're curious. )
    </blockquote>


    <h2>Abbreviation</h2>

    <p>I'm studying and <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>. I'm loving it! </p>

    <h2> Inverted text </h2>
    <p> <bdo dir="rtl"> I'm learning to create things in HTML</bdo></p>
